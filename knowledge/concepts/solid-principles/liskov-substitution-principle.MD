## Liskov substitution principle (L)

>Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

Basicly says that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

## Example

```javascript
```

Based on this principle, it should be modified as it follows:

```javascript
```
